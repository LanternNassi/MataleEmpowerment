				<h3>About Us</h3>

				<p>
					Kyotera district gained autonomy in 2017 when it was cut off from Rakai district.
					It is home to Kalisizo where Uganda first registered the first known HIV/AIDS
					case. The district also hosts the Mutukula Border point that strategically 
					supports transport and trade within the East African Community. The major
					economic activity in the district is agriculture with the main cash crop being
					coffee but not every person residing in the district has access to land. Kyotera
					district still grapples with alarming poverty amongst the populace. This has been
					attributed to a number of issues which include the high illiteracy levels, the ever
					increasing rates of child marriages; gender based discrimination on the basis of
					sex, HIV status, disability and education; unequal resource allocation and
					inadequate access to water.
				</p>
				<p>
					Uganda has a dynamic gender responsive legal and policy framework aimed at
					reducing gender-based inequalities and vulnerabilities across the different
					social, economic and political spheres. Some of the international instruments
					that we can make reference to include the Convention on the Elimination of all
					forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Platform for
					Action and the Global Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
					At the national level, the Uganda National Gender Policy, 2006, provides policy
					framework for addressing gender inequality. Uganda has made tremendous
					progress in. addressing gender inequalities and vulnerabilities through the
					establishment of social protection programs like Uganda Women Empowerment
					Program (UWEP), the Youth Livelihood Program (YLP) and the Labour Works
					Program among others. Whereas these policies and programs have expanded
					opportunities to attain gender equity and equality, gender biases remain which
					hinder full access and benefit from these programs. Another hurdle to economic
					empowerment is the limited access to financial loans to start small businesses is
					the prerequisite for presenting collateral at financial institutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					According to the Annual Police Report of 2022, of the 1358 cases that were
					reported in Kyotera district, 28 were homicides, 71 cases were economic
					offences, 48 cases were sexual abuse cases, 110 cases were child related, 376
					cases were thefts, 53 cases of robberies, 138 cases of assaults to mention but a
					few. The inference that can be drawn from this report is that the crimes bear a
					semblance of economic and social challenges and are a cause for concern. It
					suffices to note that the report doesnâ€™t capture all the incidents as some
					matters remain unreported but paints a clear picture on the issues that need to
					be addressed.
				</p>

				<p>
					MCEF has through various engagements with stakeholders in Kyotera and Rakai
					districts observed that there is a low uptake of formal education and some
					parents do not prioritise education especially for girls, Persons with Disabilities
					(PWDS), Persons Living with HIV/AIDs (PLWHIV/AIDs) and increases their
					vulnerability. Unfortunately, some of these ill-willed decisions are justified by
					negative customary norms and practices which also foster early marriages for
					girls. This combination of lack of formal education and early child bearing leaves
					girls more susceptible to Gender-based violence and limited access to livelihood
					options. This category of people usually does not benefit equally from resource
					allocation and are most times not even afforded property that can be gained
					through inheritance. Due to the negative perceptions that people attribute to
					PLWHIV/AIDs, most people that are infected loss hope and some stop accessing
					health care because they believe that if they are identified as having the virus,
					they lose out on a wide range of opportunities one of which is property
					acquisition through inheritance. Children affected and orphaned by HIV/AIDs
					are more exposed to exploitation, abuse and violence due to limited protection
					at national, community and family levels.
				</p>

				<p>
					SDG 5 enjoins state parties to put in place measures that are jeered at
					elimination of all harmful practices including child marriage and forced
					marriage. Uganda has one of the highest rates of child marriages in Sub-Saharan
					Africa and this was exacerbated by the economic downturn caused by the
					COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of schools. Despite the various laws that
					have been put in place to curb these vices that foster gender inequalities,
					adherence and implementation remain a concern. People are not well versed
					with what the law stipulates and there is alarming impunity fostered by beliefs
					and harmful cultural practices.
				</p>

				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<p>
					MCEF was inspired by the keen observation that was made by the founder of
					MCEF amongst the youths, women and children of Matale village. The founder
					was driven by the need to advocate for change in mindset within the community
					upon realizing that at the centre of the abject poverty in the area were the high
					levels of illiteracy as there was a low uptake of the formal education, the high
					rates of child marriages, discrimination in resource allocation on the basis of
					disability, HIV status and harmful gender practices. Over the years, the key
					productive aspects of skills, knowledge, attitude and values have been
					inadequate amongst these vulnerable groups in the rural communities of
					Kyotera and Rakai districts but especially in Matale village. Therefore, an
					initiative to let people participate in empowerment drives evolved with the
					primary goal of leaving no one behind and creating equal opportunities.
					However, through trainings, provision of education and sensitization programs,
					the rural communities can be revived. The overall goal of these initiatives once
					they are thoroughly implemented, the communities will have valuable and
					productive members that lead to community growth and wellbeing.
